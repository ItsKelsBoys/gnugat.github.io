[PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) is a standard providing interfaces for
HTTP messages.

The main package, [psr/http-message](https://packagist.org/packages/psr/http-message),
has a [few implementations](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-message-implementation)
but mainly it comes down to:

* [Zend Diactoros](https://packagist.org/packages/zendframework/zend-diactoros)
* [Guzzle PSR-7](https://packagist.org/packages/guzzlehttp/psr7)

The standard interfaces leave little room for implementation details by forcing
immutability and streams. It mainly leaves freedom in the way implementations
are constructed though.

> **Note**: Beyond that, Diactoros and Guzzle still differ slightly.

It's a pity we didn't end up directly with standard value objects, but we'll have
to do with those interfaces for now. So now, what's the next step for PSR-7?

## Middlewares

Middlewares have been around for a while now (in PHP as well as in other languages).
The idea is to have:

1. an interface
2. an implementation considered to be the basic one
3. implementations that wraps a call to another one

Let's take [Symfony](http://symofny.com)'s `HttpKernelInterface` as an example:

```php
<?php

namespace Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpKernelInterface;

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

interface HttpKernelInterface
{
    const MASTER_REQUEST = 1;
    const SUB_REQUEST = 2;

    // @return Response
    public function handle(Request $request, $type = self::MASTER_REQUEST, $catch = false);
}
```

Symfony provides a `HttpKernel` implementation to take care of creating a
`Response` for the given `Request`. Middlewares would wrap the call to
`HttpKernel#handle` with their own logic, which could be:

* [HTTP cache](https://github.com/gnugat/knowledge/blob/master/memo/http-cache.md), save the Response for a given Request when possible and serve the copy until it's stale
* [Content Negotiation](http://williamdurand.fr/Negotiation/), guess how to format the Response body based on the `Accept` header
* Database transaction, with the possibility to rollback on error (or always rollback for tests)

Here's an example to always rollback database transactions with [Pomm Foundation](/2015/08/06/pomm-foundation.html).

```php
<?php

namespace Acme\Fortune\Bridge\HttpKernel;

use PommProject\Foundation\QueryManager\QueryManagerInterface;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpKernelInterface;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

class RollbackKernel implements HttpKernelInterface
{
    private $httpKernel;
    private $queryManager;

    public function __construct(HttpKernelInterface $httpKernel, QueryManagerInterface $queryManager)
    {
        $this->httpKernel = $httpKernel;
        $this->queryManager = $queryManager;
    }

    // @return Response
    public function handle(Request $request, $type = self::MASTER_REQUEST, $catch = false)
    {
        $this->queryManager->query('START TRANSACTION');
        $response = $this->httpKernel->handle($request, $type, $catch);
        $this->queryManager->query('ROLLBACK');

        return $response;
    }
}
```

The [Stack](http://stackphp.com/) initiative provides visibility on those `HttpKernelInterface` middlewares.

> **Note**: Stack is inspired by Ruby's [rack](http://rack.github.io/).

## PSR-7 Middelwares

So the next step would be to provide a standard interface to allow PSR-7 middlewares.
Of course such a standard isn't straigthforward as there are many ways to create middlewares.

### 1. Take request, return response

Similar to `HttpKernelInterface`, this one just receives a `RequestInterface`
and returns a `ResponseInterface`:

```php
<?php

use Psr\Message\RequestInterface;
use Psr\Message\ResponseInterface;

interface RequestHandler
{
    // @return ResponseInterface
    public function handleRequest(RequestInterface $request);
}
```

Names can be debated, but the point here is that calling the next middleware is
up to the implementation (can use dependency injection).

[Httplug](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/httplug/introduction.html) is a good example
using this implementation.

### 2. Take request, response and next

Another interface commonly encountered forces the way of managing the next middleware:

```php
<?php

use Psr\Message\RequestInterface;
use Psr\Message\ResponseInterface;

interface RequestHanler
{
    public function handleRequest(
        RequestInterface $request,
        ResponseInterface $response,
        RequestHanler next = null
    );
}
```

This one requires the response to be passed as an argument, as well as the next
middleware.

A good example using this implementation would be [Zend Stratigility](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-stratigility/blob/master/doc/book/middleware.md)

## Conclusion

Middlewares are really powerful and PSR-7 would benefit greatly from it, but we're
missing a standard for it. As long as it will be missing, we're going to assist to
the creation of a wide range of "PSR-7 middlewares",  all incompatible with each others.

Since this seems inevitable, maybe we should instead try to figure out a new standard
that would allow to compose all those middlewares?
